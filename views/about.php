	My Name is Ryan Whalen. Since finishing High School in Binghamton NY in 2006, I have held positions in
	technical operations, information technology, network operations, desktop/laptop repair,
	and various other technical roles.

	<p class="lead">
	I am currently working as an Operations Engineer
	at Box. At Box I work to make sure that the site and its associated services are up and running, by
	proactively monitoring all of our hundreds of systems and servers.
	I make our monitoring better and more efficient, tuning alerts, making new alerts, and removing less
	useful alerts. My work also frequently includes making new tools and scripts to make sure my team
	can be more successful at what we do.

	<p class="lead">
	In my spare time I enjoy many forms of artwork, including photography, drawing in Illustrator, or
	just paper and pencil drawings. I also enjoy hiking and biking. And I sometimes dabble in a little
	bit of front end web development.
