          <p class="lead">Slurpe is a URL shortener that I made over the span of a couple weekends. I liked the idea of using something like bit.ly for short URLs. But all of the good ones were already in use, so I made my own.</p>

          <p class="lead">This is a quick and dirty project I made to see if I gave people an open forum to type anything into it, what would I get? I also dabbled a little bit into "spam filtering" on. For example preventing repeats using md5 hashes, and preventing gibberish and exessive swearing</p>
