		  <p class="lead">Barometer is project that I have been working on at Box. It is a tool for checking the health of a MySQL database server. It was originally concieved as a way for our NOC team to investigate Database problems without being granted database access. It allow us to have one low access mysql user account to access information like slave status, innodb engine status, or to see the longest running queries on a database at a given time...This project will hopefully be open sourced soon!</p>

          <p class="lead">Slurpe is a URL shortener that I made over the span of a couple weekends. I liked the idea of using something like bit.ly for short URLs. But all of the good ones were already in use, so I made my own. It also has an "api" that allows you to create a shortened URL via a curl.</p>

          <p class="lead">This is a quick and dirty project I made to see if I gave people an open forum to type anything into it, what would I get? I ended up getting into "spam filtering" on this project; attempting to create my own spam filter. For example preventing repeat entries using md5 hashes, and preventing gibberish or exessive swearing</p>
