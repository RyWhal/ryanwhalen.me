	My Name is Ryan Whalen. I am originally from from upstate New York, but currently reside
    in Sunnyvale, California. Over the past seven years I have held positions in
	technical operations, information technology, network operations, desktop and laptop repair,
	and various other technical roles.

	<p class="lead">
	I am currently working as an Operations Technician
	at Box. I work to make sure that the site and its associated services are up and running by
	proactively monitoring all of our hundreds of systems and servers.
	I make our monitoring better and more efficient by tuning alerts, making new alerts, and removing those that are less useful.
	My work also frequently includes making new tools and scripts to make sure my team
	can be more successful at what we do.

	<p class="lead">
	In my spare time I enjoy many forms of artwork, including photography, drawing in Illustrator, or
	just paper and pencil drawings. I also enjoy hiking and biking. I even sometimes dabble in a little
	bit of front end web development.
